Description: This package provides functions to easily retreive data from the 
    California Energy Commission's (CEC) Market Informed Demand Automation Server (MIDAS) 
    database of electricity rates. 
    MIDAS is a database and API providing real-time prices for time-varying retail electricity
    rates from large utilities and energy providers in California. It also provides 
    real-time carbon emissions from WattTime's Self-Generation Incentive Program (SGIP) API.
